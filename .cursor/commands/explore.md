# Exploration Phase

Your task is NOT to implement yet, but to fully understand and prepare.

**Your responsibilities:**
- Analyze the existing codebase thoroughly
- Determine how this feature integrates
- Identify dependencies, edge cases, constraints
- List all questions or ambiguities

**Remember:** Don't implement yet. Just explore, plan, and ask clarifying questions.

We will go back and forth until you have no further questions.

Please confirm you understand, then I'll describe what I want to build.
